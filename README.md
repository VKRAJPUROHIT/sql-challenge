SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

This is a research project on all employees of Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s, using the available data  

The aim of the project is to complete the following activities using SQL:

1) Create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) 

2) Create a table schema for each of the CSV file

3) Analyze the data after the complete database is obtained

4) Create charts to verfiy the results
